<h4>1. Stock_RNN</h4> This is <b>Google stock price prediction</b> using <b>Recurrent Neural Networks</b>. Specifically, LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) which is an artificial RNN architecture used for time-series prediction.

<h4>2. Data Science</h4> In a nutshell, this is a quick introduction to understand the potential of data science and machine learning used in the <b>oil industry</b>. In this notebook, I use data science to draw conclusions in the oil industry.

<h4>3. Fooda</h4> In this notebook, I have randomly generated data for a hypothetical high school food consumption. Using these data, I will look into the eating habits of these students, identify patterns and predict future food consumption inorder to reduce <b>food wastage</b> for the catering department. RNN LSTM model was used in this notebook.

<h4>4. Temperature_RNN</h4> This notebook highlights how to <b>predict temperature</b> using data from a weather station. RNN LSTM model was used in this notebook.
